             Species that have called these forests home for millennia are losing their sanctuaries forever. 
             Indigenous communities are watching their ancestral lands disappear. The Amazon, once called the
              "lungs of the Earth," has lost 17% of its original area. At current rates, scientists warn that
               many of the world's remaining primary forests could be gone within our lifetime.</p>
    
        <p className="text-xl my-5 w-[90%] mx-auto text-white">In Eastern Europe, the ancient Carpathian forests—Europe's last great wilderness—face unprecedented threats from 
            illegal logging and unsustainable practices. Romania's old-growth forests, some over 300 years old, are disappearing 
            at alarming rates, taking with them critical habitats for brown bears, lynx, and wolves. What were once vast
             green corridors connecting mountain ranges are now fragmented patches, leaving wildlife isolated and ecosystems broken.</p>
